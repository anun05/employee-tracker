  ## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**.The assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

  ## Installation
  Will need to install packages that work with Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

  ## Usage
  
  The way to use this project is by running node index.js in the command line. From here, the inquirer package will take the user to the command line where the questions will begin to appear and the user must answer them. From there you choose the departments that will be viewed, then employees, their role etc. Ultimately, this will create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.
